/// 1. A variable name can't contain any spaces.
/// 2. A variable name can contain only letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores.
// 3. Though a variable name can't be any of JavaScript's keywords, it can contain keywords.
//    For example, userAlert and myVar are legal.
// 4. Capital letters are fine, but be careful.Variable names are case sensitive.A rose is not a
//    Rose.If you assign the string "Floribundas" to the variable rose, and then ask JavaScript
//    for the value assigned to Rose, you'll come up empty.
// advice we need to follow //
/* 5. I teach the camelCase naming convention.Why "camelCase" ? Because there is a hump or
    two(or three) in the middle if the name is formed by more than one word.A camelCase
    name begins in lower case.If there's more than one word in the name, each subsequent
    word gets an initial cap, creating a hump.If you form a variable name with only one
    word, like response, there's no hump. It's a camel that's out of food. Please adopt the
    camelCase convention.It'll make your variable names more readable, and you'll be less
    likely to get variable names mixed up.
Examples:
userResponse
userResponseTime
userRespone
